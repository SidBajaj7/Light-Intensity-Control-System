# Photocatalytic Reactor Light Intensity Control System

This project focuses on the control of light intensity inside a photocatalytic reactor using LabVIEW and DAQ (Data Acquisition) hardware. The reactor was designed in SolidWorks with a specific emphasis on minimizing light escape, thereby improving energy efficiency and reaction performance.

## üîç Project Overview

Photocatalytic reactions are highly sensitive to light intensity. Maintaining optimal lighting conditions is critical for consistent and efficient reaction outcomes. This project aims to:

- Design a reactor that minimizes light loss.
- Implement a LabVIEW-based control system to regulate light intensity in real-time.
- Integrate the system with DAQ hardware for responsive and automated control.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- **LabVIEW**: Used to develop a user-friendly interface and control logic for adjusting light intensity.
- **DAQ System**: Interfaced with LabVIEW to modulate the power supplied to the light source based on control inputs.
- **SolidWorks**: Utilized for the 3D design of the photocatalytic reactor with light retention in focus.
- **Photocatalytic Reactor Hardware**: A custom-built setup that supports controlled light exposure for catalytic reactions.
